Today, I would like to share how to configure your Java project with Maven and
Sonar, a powerful tool for continuous code quality analysis. After reading this
article, you'll understand:

- What is SonarQube and SonarCloud
- How to configure Sonar in Maven
- How to configure Jenkins
- Settings in SonarCloud
- Suppress Sonar warnings in your project

## Introduction of SonarQube and SonarCloud

SonarQube provides the capability to not only show health of an application but
also to highlight issues newly introduced. With a Quality Gate in place, you can
fix the leak and therefore improve code quality systematically. Sonar code
analyzers are equipped powerful path sensitive dataflow engines to detect tricky
issues such as null-pointers dereferences, logic errors, resource leaks...

They have also an online version, [Sonar Cloud][sonar-cloud], which allows you
to upload the analyse result without hosting the SonarQube server yourself.
Here's an example coming from my own project _"Alumni Server"_:

## Maven Configuration

There're 2 parts that we need to configure in Maven:

- Plugin management: define the behaviors of Sonar and [JaCoCo][jacoco].
- Profile: define a profile for SonarCloud execution

In the Maven `<pluginManagement>` section, we need to configure the default
behaviors of Sonar plugin, meaning that we define the version used, the goal
binding of Sonar scanner. Binding `sonar:sonar` to verify helps us the
facilitate the code analysis: sonar will be executed any Maven command in which
phase `verify` is included. In the same time, we also define JaCoCo, a Maven
plugin for detecting the test coverage of unit tests and integration tests,
using respectively the goals `prepare-agent` and `prepare-agent-integration`.
Test coverage report will be generated by goal `report`.

{% highlight xml %}
<pluginManagement>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.5.0.1254</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>verify</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>sonar</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
      <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.2</version>
      <configuration>
        <append>true</append>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>prepare-agent</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
          <id>prepare-agent-integration</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>prepare-agent-integration</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
          <id>jacoco-site</id>
          <phase>verify</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>report</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
{% endhighlight %}

In the Maven `<profile>` section, create a new profile for Sonar code analysis.
You need to define certain [Sonar analysis parameters][sonar-params], in order
to match your SonarQube instance requirements.

{% highlight xml %}
<profile>
  <id>sonar</id>
  <properties>
    <sonar.host.url>https://sonarcloud.io</sonar.host.url>
    <sonar.organization>mincong-h-github</sonar.organization>
  </properties>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
        <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</profile>
{% endhighlight %}

Once every configuration is ready, you can run Sonar code analysis alongside
with all the tests as following in your local machine, where `SONAR_LOGIN_TOKEN`
is the [authentication token][sonar-token] of a SonarQube user with
_Execute Analysis_ permission:

    mvn clean verify -P sonar \
        -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_LOGIN_TOKEN

In my case, it seems that I must let sonar to execute with the tests, so that
Java code coverage plugin JaCoCo can analyse the test results correctly.
Otherwise, the code coverage will be 0.

## Jenkins Configuration

The next step is to configure Sonar analysis on Jenkins. The goal is to
integrate Sonar as part of the master job. In order to do that, you need to have
a Sonar token for Jenkins. Once you have done this, you need to modify your job
as follows:

- Enable option **Use secret text(s) or file(s)** in section Build Environment
- Add binding **Username and password (separated)** in Bindings
  - Keep "Username variable" empty
  - Name "Password variable" as `$SONAR_LOGIN_TOKEN`
  - Credentials of type "Specific credentials" and select the Sonar one from
    from the list. In my case, the SonarCloud token is already available on
    Jenkins. If it's not your case, you might need to contact your
    administrator.
- Build as maven-3 with goals and options:

      clean verify -P sonar -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_LOGIN_TOKEN

Screenshot of SonarCloud token configuration in Jenkins job:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/20171209-jenkins-sonar-cloud-configuration.png"
       style="max-width:350px"
       alt="SonarCloud configuration in Jenkins job" />
</p>

Now, your Jenkins job is ready. After running the job once, you should be able
to see your code analysis on Sonar cloud. Notice that, if the target project
does not exist on SonarCloud and the token has enough permission, SonarCloud
will create the project after the first analysis report upload. Else, you need
to ask the organization admin to create it for you on SonarCloud.

## SonarCloud Configuration

It's preferable to use a machine account to upload code analysis via Jenkins.
Before uploading, ensure that the machine account has enough permission to do
it. In other words, this account need to be a member of the target
organization.

## Suppress Sonar Warnings

Sometimes you might want to suppress Sonar warnings in a specific scope. It
allows to disable inappropriate analyze results.

Suppress all warnings at one line:

{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hi"); // NOSONAR
{% endhighlight %}

Suppress one specific warning at method level:

{% highlight java %}
@SuppressWarnings("squid:S106")
public void sayHi() {
  System.out.println("Hi");
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Next Steps

Now we've successfully configured the Sonar scanner in Maven for the first
analysis. As for the next steps, I think you might be interested in:

- Exploring the analysis results in Sonar
- Replace classical Jenkins job by [`Jenkinsfiles`][jenkinsfiles] pipeline
- Configure GitHub integration of Sonar auto-reply in pull requests
- Enable SonarLint in your IDE

They're the future topics that I might be presented in my blog. Thanks for your
attention. Please stay tuned!
