## Introduction

If you use an Elasticsearch cluster in production, I believe you must have heard of Elasticsearch's [snapshot and restore feature](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/snapshot-restore-apis.html), because it is an important means to ensure that cluster data is not lost. There are a lot of materials on the Internet about how to use Elasticsearch snapshots, but there are very few articles about its implementation. Today, I want to discuss with you the internal structure of the Elasticsearch snapshot repository. Knowing it can give us a better understanding of how Elasticsearch's snapshots work, and can also provide more ideas for troubleshooting when there is a problem in production.

After reading this article, you will understand:

- What is a snapshot repository?
- Different files inside a snapshot repository
- Learning more about `index-N` files
- Learning more about the `index.latest` file
- Learning more about snapshot information files

Without further ado, let's get started right away!

## What is a snapshot repository?

A snapshot repository is a location where Elasticsearch stores snapshots. One snapshot repository can store multiple snapshots. Snapshots are how Elasticsearch backups your data. You can create a snapshot for one single index or multiple indices. Inside a snapshot repository, snapshots are incremental: new snapshots will only snapshot those parts that were not snapshotted in the previous snapshot to avoid wasting time and storage space. There are many types of snapshot repositories: they can be local repository or remote repositories for  cloud providers, such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Aliyun OSS, etc.

## Different files inside a snapshot repository

Below, let's take a look the different files stored inside a snapshot repository. Here is an excerpt from the [Javadoc of Elasticsearch 7.12 about Snapshot Repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.12/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/blobstore/package-info.java):

```
 STORE_ROOT
 |- index-N           - JSON serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.repositories.RepositoryData} containing a list of all snapshot ids
 |                      and the indices belonging to each snapshot, N is the generation of the file
 |- index.latest      - contains the numeric value of the latest generation of the index file (i.e. N from above)
 |- incompatible-snapshots - list of all snapshot ids that are no longer compatible with the current version of the cluster
 |- snap-20131010.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.snapshots.SnapshotInfo} for snapshot "20131010"
 |- meta-20131010.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.Metadata } for snapshot "20131010"
 |                      (includes only global metadata)
 |- snap-20131011.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.snapshots.SnapshotInfo} for snapshot "20131011"
 |- meta-20131011.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.Metadata } for snapshot "20131011"
 .....
 |- indices/ - data for all indices
    |- Ac1342-B_x/ - data for index "foo" which was assigned the unique id Ac1342-B_x (not to be confused with the actual index uuid)
    |  |             in the repository
    |  |- meta-20131010.dat - JSON Serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.IndexMetadata} for index "foo"
    |  |- 0/ - data for shard "0" of index "foo"
    |  |  |- __1                      \  (files with numeric names were created by older ES versions)
    |  |  |- __2                      |
    |  |  |- __VPO5oDMVT5y4Akv8T_AO_A |- files from different segments see snap-* for their mappings to real segment files
    |  |  |- __1gbJy18wS_2kv1qI7FgKuQ |

    |  |  .....
    |  |  |- snap-20131010.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.index.snapshots.blobstore.BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshot} for
    |  |  |                      snapshot "20131010"
    |  |  |- snap-20131011.dat - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.index.snapshots.blobstore.BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshot} for
    |  |  |                      snapshot "20131011"
    |  |  |- index-123         - SMILE serialized {@link org.elasticsearch.index.snapshots.blobstore.BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshots} for
    |  |  |                      the shard (files with numeric suffixes were created by older versions, newer ES versions use a uuid
    |  |  |                      suffix instead)
    |  |
    |  |- 1/ - data for shard "1" of index "foo"
    |  |  |- __1
    |  |  |- index-Zc2SS8ZgR8JvZAHlSMyMXy - SMILE serialized {@code BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshots} for the shard
    |  |  .....
    |  |
    |  |-2/
    |  ......
    |
    |- 1xB0D8_B3y/ - data for index "bar" which was assigned the unique id of 1xB0D8_B3y in the repository
    ......
```

Organize them again in a table:

File path | explanation
:--- | :---
`index-N` | `RepositoryData` serialized in JSON format, including all snapshot IDs and their corresponding indexes. N represents the generation of this file.
`index.latest` | The file is a pointer that represents the last generation index file in digital form, which is the number N mentioned above. Here N is a hexadecimal number, for example, the index of the 100th generation (decimal), and finally represented by 64 in hexadecimal, because 64 = 16*6 + 4.
`incompatible-snapshots` | A list of all snapshot IDs that are no longer compatible with the current cluster version
`snap-20131010.dat` | `SnapshotInfo` serialized in SMILE format, used to represent the information corresponding to the snapshot 20131010
`meta-20131010.dat` | `Metadata` serialized in SMILE format, used to represent the metadata corresponding to the snapshot 20131010  (includes only global metadata)
`indices/` | Data for all indices
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/` | Index the data corresponding to foo. The UUID of the index in the repository is Ac1342-B_x. But do not confuse with the UUID of the index.
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/meta-20131010.dat` | Index foo `IndexMetadata` serialized in JSON format
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/` | Index foo data corresponding to shard 0
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/__1` | Files ending in numbers were created by an older version of Elasticsearch
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/__2` | Same as above
`Indices / Ac1342-B_x / 0 / __ VPO5oDMVT5y4Akv8T_AO_A` | segment files, with specific mappings real segment, see `snap-*` file
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/__1gbJy18wS_2kv1qI7FgKuQ` | Same as above
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/__R8JvZAHlSMyMXyZc2SS8Zg` | Same as above
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/snap-20131010.dat` | Snapshot 20131010 `BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshot` serialized in SMILE format
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/snap-20131011.dat` | Snapshot 20131011 `BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshot` serialized in SMILE format
`indices/Ac1342-B_x/0/index-123` | Shard 0 `BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshots` serialized in SMILE format. Files with numeric suffixes were created by older versions, newer ES versions use a uuid suffix instead

## Data Preparation

Next, let's take a look at some of the more important files.

But before getting started, we need to prepare the data locally: by starting Elasticsearch, and creating some data and snapshots.

```sh
es_repo="${HOME}/es-backup/blog-snapshot-repo-structure/"

# Start Elasticsearch
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p 9200:9200 \
  -p 9300:9300 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "cluster.name=es-docker-cluster" \
  -e "path.repo=/opt/elasticsearch/backup" \
  -v "${es_repo}:/opt/elasticsearch/backup" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.12.0

# Create document
curl -X PUT localhost:9200/my_index/_doc/1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"msg": "Hello Elasticsearch"}'

# Create snapshot repository
curl -X PUT localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_repo \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "type": "fs",
  "settings": {
    "location": "my_repo"
  }
}'

# Create snapshot
curl -X PUT localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_repo/my_snapshot_1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "indices": "my_index",
  "include_global_state": false,
  "metadata": {
    "taken_by": "Mincong",
    "taken_because": "https://mincong.io is the best blog for learning Elasticsearch"
  }
}'
```

Then enter the local folder `blog-snapshot-repo-structure`, make sure the repository `my_repo` and the files in it are ready: 

```
âžœ  blog-snapshot-repo-structure find my_repo
my_repo
my_repo/index-0
my_repo/indices
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0/index-MwjmFzyOT_2NI6DdXLcsNw
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0/__IlzZcMdOSkC-j6xx0Qj04A
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0/snap-2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ.dat
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0/__jQbQk7YYTwW8G5gL_RtR8w
my_repo/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/meta-N1BHtXsBYxjWXi8lXhTR.dat
my_repo/index.latest
my_repo/meta-2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ.dat
my_repo/snap-2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ.dat
```

Now, we can further explore the contents of the repository! 

## File index-N


```sh
cat index-0 | jq
```

```js
{
  "min_version": "7.12.0",
  "uuid": "C87ijmZURAK3ij8MsAaDAw",
  "cluster_id": "aSNpPgDAShyYAiKhsun6IA",
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "name": "my_snapshot_1",
      "uuid": "2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ",
      "state": 1,
      "index_metadata_lookup": {
        "Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg": "Uz7B9HV2SJ6peiLiUMJhyg-_na_-1-2-1"
      },
      "version": "7.12.0"
    }
  ],
  "indices": {
    "my_index": {
      "id": "Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg",
      "snapshots": [
        "2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ"
      ],
      "shard_generations": [
        "MwjmFzyOT_2NI6DdXLcsNw"
      ]
    }
  },
  "index_metadata_identifiers": {
    "Uz7B9HV2SJ6peiLiUMJhyg-_na_-1-2-1": "N1BHtXsBYxjWXi8lXhTR"
  }
}
```

```
$ curl "localhost:9200/_cat/indices/my_index?v"
health status index    uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
yellow open   my_index Uz7B9HV2SJ6peiLiUMJhyg   1   1          1            0      3.9kb          3.9kb
```

The above file `index-0` represents generation 0 of the snapshot repository. It is a `RepositoryData` serialized in JSON format, which contains all the snapshot IDs and their corresponding indexes. The UUID of the index `my_index` in the repository is `Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg`, and its corresponding UUID in the cluster is `Uz7B9HV2SJ6peiLiUMJhyg`. This index is referenced by a snapshot, which is the snapshot `my_snapshot_1` (`2hiUzvH3RPCp9iOeiTa6TQ`).

## File index.latest

The `index.latest` file is a pointer that represents the last-generation index file in numerical form, which is the number N mentioned above. Here N is a hexadecimal number, for example, the index of the 100th generation (decimal) is represented as 64 in hexadecimal, because 64 = 16*6 + 4. In the repository `my_repo` prepared above, since only one snapshot was taken, it is the 0th generation:

```
âžœ hexdump index.latest
0000000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0000008
```

Now, let's generate more documents and create more snapshots, so that we can better view the changes in `index.latest`:

```sh
for i in {2..20}
do
  echo "Creating document ${i}"
  curl -s -X PUT "localhost:9200/my_index/_doc/${i}" \
    -H'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"msg\": \"Hello Elasticsearch ${i}\"}"

  echo "Creating snapshot ${i}"
  curl -s -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_repo/my_snapshot_${i}" \
    -H'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d'{
    "indices": "my_index",
    "include_global_state": false,
    "metadata": {
      "taken_by": "Mincong",
      "taken_because": "https://mincong.io is the best blog for learning Elasticsearch"
    }
  }'
done
```

At this time, `index.latest` has become the 19th generation (starting from the 0 generation, so it is actually the 20th generation). 19 = 16*1 + 3

```
âžœ hexdump index.latest
0000000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 13
0000008
```

```
âžœ echo'ibase=16; 13' | bc
19
```

But how does Elasticsearch load the `RepositoryData` through `index-N` and `index.latest` files?

Loading `RepositoryData` and the mapping of index name to its repository `IndexId`, which is done by calling `BlobStoreRepository.getRepositoryData()`. The specific implementation is as follows ([extracted from Javadoc](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.12/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/blobstore/package-info.java)):

1. Step 1: Storing repository data
   1. The blobstore repository stores the `RepositoryData` in blobs named with incrementing suffix `N` at `/index-N` directly under the repository's root.
   2. For each `BlobStoreRepository` an entry of type `RepositoryMetadata` exists in the cluster state. It tracks the current valid generation `N` as well as the latest generation that a write was attempted for.
   3. The blobstore also stores the most recent `N` as a 64bit long in the blob `/index.latest` directly under the repository's root.
2. Step 2: Determine the value of N
   1. First, find the most recent `RepositoryData` by getting a list of all index-N blobs through listing all blobs with prefix "index-" under the repository root and then selecting the one with the highest value for N.
   2. If this operation fails because the repository's `BlobContainer` does not support list operations (in the case of read-only repositories), read the highest value of N from the `index.latest` blob.
3. Step 3: Deserialization
   1. Use the just determined value of `N` and get the `/index-N` blob and deserialize the `RepositoryData` from it.
   2. If no value of `N` could be found since neither an `index.latest` nor any `index-N` blobs exist in the repository, it is assumed to be empty and `RepositoryData#EMPTY` is returned.

## Repo-Level Snapshot Info

`SnapshotInfo` serialized in SMILE format is used to represent the information related to the snapshot. The following is the snapshot info for `my_snapshot_20` (`snap-WbjaeQk1T4u2JrGfsWlHsw.dat`). By the way, it is worth mentioning that there is no way to directly inspect files in SMILE format (for example, using `cat`). You need a special demodulation tool, such as [cowtowncoder/Jackformer](https://github.com/cowtowncoder/Jackformer). After converting to JSON, we obtain the results as:

```js
// decoded version of repository-level snapshot info
// $STORE_ROOT/snap-WbjaeQk1T4u2JrGfsWlHsw.dat
{
  "snapshot" : {
    "name" : "my_snapshot_20",
    "uuid" : "WbjaeQk1T4u2JrGfsWlHsw",
    "version_id" : 7120099,
    "indices" : [ "my_index" ],
    "data_streams" : [ ],
    "state" : "SUCCESS",
    "include_global_state" : false,
    "metadata" : {
      "taken_by" : "Mincong",
      "taken_because" : "https://mincong.io is the best blog for learning Elasticsearch"
    },
    "start_time" : 1630835219489,
    "end_time" : 1630835222295,
    "total_shards" : 1,
    "successful_shards" : 1,
    "failures" : [ ],
    "feature_states" : [ ]
  }
}
```

## Shard-Level Snapshot Info

We can do the same thing for shard-level snapshot information, such as this one `snap-WbjaeQk1T4u2JrGfsWlHsw.dat`:

```js
// decoded version of shard-level snapshot info
// $STORE_ROOT/indices/Uxom82JcSfORXgbtZ4jLSg/0/snap-WbjaeQk1T4u2JrGfsWlHsw.dat
{
  "name" : "my_snapshot_20",

## Conclusion

In this article, we walked into Elasticsearch's snapshot repository and saw its internal structure. We also learn more about `index-N`, `index.latest`, and some other files related to snapshots. I hope that by knowing these files, it will give you a have a better understanding of Elasticsearch's "snapshot and restore" feature, and also give you more ideas for troubleshooting when there is an issue on production. Finally, we briefly saw some resources to expand out.
