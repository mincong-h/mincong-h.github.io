## Introduction

Every chapter has an end and we finally finished the year 2020. 2020 was a
difficult year for everyone and COVID-19 changed completely the way we work and
live. Many people were infected, some left forever. That's why I chose a grey
image from Kelly Sikkema for this article: to remember the people that were
impacted, to remember that life can be challenging, and to thank those who
protect us and avoid the situation being worse.

Despite all the difficulties, I am lucky enough to say that 2020 was a good
year for me. In this article, I would like to share my technical journey
at Datadog as a software engineer working for data storage. Some personal projects I
did during my free time, such as open-source project VAVR and this technical blog
<https://mincong.io>. They are not just about what I did, but also
some thoughts and lessons learned that I want to share with you. Now, let's get started!

## Datadog

I joined Datadog at the end of 2019 as a software engineer working for the Event
Platform. Event Platform ingests trillions of events per day for different
products: Logs, APM, Profiling, Real User Monitoring (RUM), Security Analytics,
Error Tracking, Network Monitoring, and more. I am mainly working on the storage
part, where we host thousands of servers for storing these events. I am really
proud of being part of the team. There are many technical challenges to handle and my
teammates are very talented. Back in 2019, I wrote an article ["Datadog
Onboarding Recap"](/2019/11/17/dd-onboarding/). But now, after working a full
year here, I found more interesting points to share with you.

**Reliability.** Reliability is the key to our backend services. We spent a lot
of effort to: ensure service availability, reduce the impact across
services when a problem happens, reduce the impact across customers, and ensure
that we don't lose any customer data. This is important for any SaaS
application, but I believe it's even more important for Datadog as a monitoring
tool. People usually use Datadog in a critical situation, such as during an
incident, so Datadog cannot disappoint them. This year, I contributed to this
field in many tasks, such as adding throttling to some services to reduce the impact at peak
activity; backing-off client requests when servers are overloaded; participate
in the changes of data lifecycle so that we snapshot and restore data
continuously and much more.

**Observability.** When I was a junior developer, I cared a lot about the
correctness of the code. But the reality is not just about right and wrong, it's
more complex than that. Many factors can make software not working as
expected: the traffic volume, the network conditions, the hardware, the order of
execution, the parallelism, the state of the server, etc. Having observability
makes it much easier to operate a running system. Talking about observability,
we can use metrics, logs, tracing, etc to observe our application and the
underlying infrastructure. At Datadog, I learned how to write code with
observability in mind. Some basic ideas are: adding a log when the code faces an
important event; providing metrics about the application state or resources;
adding spans to code blocks to understand and visualize the workflow; measuring the
performance with statistics (p50, p90, p95, p99).

**On-call.** In our platform with 50+ engineers and managers, everyone
participates in on-call rotations. No matter you are a software engineer, a team
lead, or a director, you need to be part of the rotation. We do that 24/7,
i.e. whenever there is a problem in production, at least one person is notified
and has to reply in minutes. There is also an escalation policy to ensure we don't
miss any potential problems. This policy is also here to help the primary on-call
person for bigger incidents (outages) because one person may not be enough. This
year is the first time I participated in the on-call activity. I cannot say that I
enjoyed it, that would be a lie. Being paged at 3 AM in the morning trying to fix
a problem isn't fun at all. But globally speaking, it's worth the effort because
it reminds us of the importance of site reliability. If we were paged, it means our
customers are having problems â€” at least a subset of them. It is a great
motivation to improve the system and avoid the same problem from happening again.

**Multi-language.** We use multiple programming languages to build our services.
The majority of the Event Platform services are written in Java, but we also use JS
for the front-end, Python and Bash for scripting, and Go for the agents.
This is a good opportunity to
learn other languages, know the advantages and inconveniences of each of them.
It also forces us to think about packaging and communication flow between
services. For example, we deliver Docker images as artifacts, use RESTful APIs
for many exchanges. On my side, I learned a lot about Python this year working
on scripting and an internal toolbox for Elasticsearch clusters. I definitely
miss the strong typing of Java, but I enjoy using JSON in Python, which is much
easier.

## OSS

### Vavr

[Vavr](https://github.com/vavr-io) (formerly called Javaslang) is a non-commercial, non-profit
object-functional library that runs with Java 8+. It aims to reduce the lines
of code and increase code quality. It brings the concept of Scala to the Java
ecosystem. After being a member of this project, I contributed several patches
to Vavr in 2020:

<img src="/assets/20210102-vavr-2020.png"
     alt="My contributions to VAVR organization" />

Vavr-core:

- [#2572 Support Option.orNull()](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/pull/2572)
- [#2577 Iterate once to create two iterators in
  partition](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/pull/2577)

Vavr-jackson:

- [#155 Collection serializers and deserializer should be contextual](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr-jackson/pull/155)
- [#158 Serializer and deserializer of Map and Multimap should be contextual](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr-jackson/pull/158)
- [#163 Support deserializeNullAsEmpty for maps](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr-jackson/pull/163)
- [#166 Deserialize classes Option.{Some,None}](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr-jackson/pull/166)

You can see the complete list of contributions [here for
vavr-core](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amincong-h)
and [here for
vavr-jackson](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr-jackson/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amincong-h).
I also wrote an article for the [release note of vavr-jackson 1.0.0 Alpha
3](https://blog.vavr.io/vavr-jackson-1-0-0-alpha-3/) in <https://blog.vavr.io>.
However, starting from this summer, I lost my interest in continuing the
contributions because I don't have the opportunity to use vavr in Datadog and I
don't see other opportunities to use this library in the mid-term. So I stopped
investigating my time on it and tried to put effort into other fields that are
more related to my current work.

### Algorithm

I have two GitHub repositories about the algorithm and I want to share them with you
today.

<img src="/assets/20210102-algo.png"
     alt="GitHub projects: mincong-h/algorithm-princeton and AlgoStudyGroup/Leetcode" />

[mincong-h/algorithm-princeton](https://github.com/mincong-h/algorithm-princeton)
-- This project contains my solutions for the Coursera online course:
Introduction to Algorithms, created by Princeton University, taught by Kevin
Wayne, Senior Lecturer, and Robert Sedgewick, Professor. I created this project
when I learned the course back in 2016 and stop maintaining it after. People
keep adding stars since then and now reached 90 stars!! I am quite surprised by
the popularity of the project but I am happy to see that people love it and find
it useful. It makes me understand that hard work gets paid in the end, but you
need to be patient to see that day coming. It also encourages me to write software
with the quality so that it will still work years after.

[AlgoStudyGroup/Leetcode](https://github.com/AlgoStudyGroup/Leetcode) -- This
project contains solutions of multiple LeetCode challenges starting
from Challenge April 2020 to Challenge November 2020. The solutions are written
in different languages: C++, C#, Python, Java, Scala, JS, Kotlin. This project
was created by [Shendan Jin](https://github.com/jinshendan) and followed by many
other Chinese developers in France when we were bored during the May holidays
and the COVID lockdown. It was fun!

## Blogging

In 2020, I wrote 28 articles and updated some existing ones. Most of these blog
posts are about Java and Elasticsearch. They reflect on what I learned and practiced in my
daily work. Here you can see an overview of them, grouped by quarter:

<img src="/assets/20210102-2020-overview.png"
     alt="Blogging overview for 2020" />

I like writing blog posts because it has several advantages.

- It is a good way to express technology in a human-readable way. Different
  from writing code, this way is more accessible to most people, even
  for those that have a little knowledge about the target framework or the language.
- It expresses the motivation and reasoning behind logical choices. Why we need
  this, why we need that, why shouldn't we do it in this way, etc. As developers,
  we need to make decisions every day, it's important to know the pros and cons,
  argue the benefits and potential risks face to choices.
- It structures my skills. When writing code, I only know the fraction of the
  framework I use. Writing articles allow me to take a step back and understand
  the big picture and other important aspects provided by the product/framework/language.

In 2020, I received 234k page views from 182k users all around the world. It's a
25% increase in terms of page views and a 23% increase in terms of users. Over the
4 years, the traffic grew and dropped, there were a lot of back-and-forths. For
example, it dropped significantly end of last year when my article [Git:
Upstream Tracking Understanding](/2018/05/02/git-upstream-tracking/) was not
featured by Google anymore and when I changed the domain name from
<https://mincong-h.github.io> to <https://mincong.io>. But overall, the trend is
growing up. Back to the 234k page view, it's
such a pleasure to see that my articles are useful for other people! It gives me
the motivation to continue writing. Writing for the author himself may just be a daily
task, but for readers, it may be the answer for a long-pending problem, a solution
for a bug encountered in production, a confusing issue that requires
clarification. This reminds me to always go further in my
article, find the value points for readers.

<img src="/assets/20210102-blog-stats-last-4-years.png"
     alt="Google Analytics - The statistics of my blog mincong.io from 2017 to 2020" />

Among all the articles written this year, the top 3 articles getting the most
page views are:

1. [Mockito: 3 Ways to Init Mock in JUnit 5](/2020/04/19/mockito-junit5/)
   (13,340 page views)
2. [3 Ways to Handle Exception In Completable
   Future](/2020/05/30/exception-handling-in-completable-future/) (10,031 page
   views)
3. [Elasticsearch Scroll API](/2020/01/19/elasticsearch-scroll-api/) (2,486 page
   views)

I hope that in 2021, I can share more valuable articles with you!
