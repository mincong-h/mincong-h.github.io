## Introduction

If you are born in China or live there, you must be familiar with WeChat.
WeChat (微信) is a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment
app developed by Tencent. But do you ever wonder: what happens when you use
WeChat? What kinds of interactions it has with the server? What are the
information stored in your device? Why sometime is it slow to use WeChat as an
overseas Chinese? In this article, we are going to explore these questions, with
a main focus on the networking part. I am going to use my personal account as a
test, and see what happens. Note that I am currently living in Paris, France. So
the interactions may be different from yours.

After reading this article, you will understand what are the main websites used
by WeChat, how is a typical route of an HTTP request, how does WeChat store the
information in MacOS, etc. Hopefully, it will allow you to learn a bit more
about network troubleshooting and Tencent Cloud as well. Now, let's get started!

## Environment

The test is made with the following hardware and software:

* Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019)
* WeChat MacOS (3.8.0)
* OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (2.12.0)
* Wireshark - Network Protocol Analyzer (4.0.6)
* `traceroute` (1.4a12+Darwin)
* `host` (9.10.6)
