Year 2017 is the first year in which I start my first full-time job as a
software engineer. Therefore, I want to share with you some goals and
expectation about this year. I try to split the goals into several parts: the
Oracle Java Certifications, the goal of Stack Overflow, Hibernate Search, the
goal in my work at Nuxeo and the improvement of my English level.

## Oracle Java Certifications

Oracle has a series of certifications in Java. As a full-stack Java Developer,
I'm very interested in learning more about Java and pass these certifications.
The idea is to learn the basic and common skills in Java programming, which will
bring help to the future: facilitate the code understanding, shorten the
development time for complex tasks, understand the best practice and more. In
terms of technologies, these certifications are related to almost each field of
the Java language, e.g. Basic Expression, Concept of Class Oriented Prgramming,
Multi-threading, Serialization, File IO, Lambda Expression. There're different
levels in the certifications, I wish to pass the following this year:

- OCAJP: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer
- OCPJP: Orable Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer

A GitHub repository [mincong-h/oracle-certification][1] had been created for it.
The objective is to collect questions and tips related to the certifications.

## Stack Overflow

As for Stack Overflow, I earned about 1000 points the last year. Thanks to this
amazing website, I learned a lot by helping the others. My top fields are `java`
and `sql`. It's really an interesting to be able to help people and improve my
own skills. This year's goal will be 2000 points. It shouldn't be too hard to
achieve and I believe `java` will help me to get there.

## Hibernate Search

A lot of code has been created during the Google Summer of Code for Hibernate
Search. However, they have never been merged into the offical repository. This
project is then interrupted by other things. Thanks to Yoann, the member of
Hibernate Team, all the blockers issues have been resolved and I should be
able to merge it into Hibernate this year.

## Nuxeo

Yesterday, I joined officially the Nuxeo Online Services (NOS) team. NOS is
responsible for the development of Nuxeo Connect and Nuxeo Studio. Currently, I
still don't have much detail about my missions, but I believe this is a great
opportunity to contribute to Nuxeo and give customers better experience while
using Nuxeo's oneline services. My expectation about this field is to able to
product some measurable result at the end of the year, such as code refactoring,
performance imrovement, new feature.

## English Skills

English is becoming more and more important in my daily missions. Almost all the
tasks are in English, e.g. the specification, code, blog, Q&A. So it's important
to improve my English level to better handle these tasks. I saw a book called
_[The Elements of Styles][elements-of-style]_, which helps to improve the
English skills for foreigners. It would be interesting to complete this book
this year. And my colleague, Ronan, suggested me to pay for some English lessons
too. I might try that, in particular for orale skill improvement and blog
articles correction.

## At The End

2017 is a brand new year and there're a lot of things to be discovered. I tried
not to define too mush goals for this year and achieve all of them at the end of
the year. By the way, what about you? Do you have your own goals for 2017? It
would be interested to hear from you too. You can send me an email at mincong.h
_at_ gmail.com. Thanks for reading, bye!
