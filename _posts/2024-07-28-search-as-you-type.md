## Introduction

The [`search_as_you_type`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-as-you-type.html) field type is a text-like field that is optimized to provide out-of-the-box support for queries that serve an as-you-type completion use case. This article shares the experience of implementing this feature for the Chrome extension [ChatGPT QuickSearch](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-quicksearch/jclniokkhcjpgfijopjahldoepdikcko), a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly search the conversation history directly in ChatGPT by providing a search bar. This article talks about the choice of field data types for the mappings, the choice of queries, highlighting, frontend and observability related to this feature. Now, let's get started!

## Mappings

Configuring the mappings of the index correctly is important because they can only be done before the insertion of the data. These types cannot be changed once the field is created for an index. For the search-as-you-type feature, choosing the field type `search_as_you_type` is a natural choice. It creates a series of subfields that are analyzed to index terms that can be efficiently matched by a query that partially matches the entire indexed text value. The search-as-you-type field creates 3 sub-fields: `${my_field}._2gram`, `${my_field}._3gram`, and `${my_field}._index_prefix` for the top-level field.

Those shingles subfields are used to create multi-token sequences from text input, which can help improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. Shingles help in matching phrases or multi-word expressions accurately. For instance, the phrase "New York City" can be tokenized as "New York" and "York City", allowing the search engine to better understand and match the phrase. "New York" and "York City" are shingles of size 2 while "New York City" is a shingle of size 3.

We also use an edge ngram field to split a word into N grams starting from the edge â€” the left side of the word. This is another way to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results when a user types part of the word. Using an edge ngram is also useful for highlighting, since users probably want to highlight the part of the word matching their queries.
