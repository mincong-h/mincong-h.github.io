## Introduction

The [`search_as_you_type`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-as-you-type.html) field type is a text-like field that is optimized to provide out-of-the-box support for queries that serve an as-you-type completion use case. This article shares the experience of implementing this feature for the Chrome extension [ChatGPT QuickSearch](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-quicksearch/jclniokkhcjpgfijopjahldoepdikcko), a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly search the conversation history directly in ChatGPT by providing a search bar.
