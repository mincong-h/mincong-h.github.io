## Overview

Time flies and another year passed. Today, I'd like to share with you my year
2019 as a software engineer. The fun, the hard, the unexpected, and the amazing
parts. In this article, I will talk about my working experience at Nuxeo and
Datadog. Then, share my open-source experience at VAVR and end with the blogging
I've been doing for the whole year.

- Open-source project: VAVR
- Blogging

Let's get started!

## Nuxeo

[Nuxeo](https://www.nuxeo.com) is a content management platform to build modern
business applications. I work at Nuxeo Online Services (NOS) Team, a SaaS
(software as a service) application including all online services of Nuxeo:
Nuxeo Studio, Nuxeo Marketplace, Nuxeo Connect Dashboard, Nuxeo Register, and
command-line tool "nuxeoctl". The main programming language used by Nuxeo is
Java. This year, I spent 10 months at Nuxeo before leaving the company.
At Nuxeo, I worked on improving the versioning system based on JGit, adding RESTful
API, creating Docker image, and solving performance bottlenecks. There were many
backgrounds works as well, such as bug-fixing, upgrading legacy frameworks,
CI improvement, release, deploy, operations and monitoring of our production.
The work is challenging since we are a small team (1 PO + 1
designer + 2 front-end engineers + 3 back-end engineers).

I wrote another article, [Nuxeo 2019](/2019/10/07/nuxeo-2019/), which explains
more in detail about what I did this year at Nuxeo over plan, code, build,
test, release, deploy, operation and monitor. You can check that if interested :)
After working 3 years at Nuxeo, I chose to leave for another challenge: I joined
Datadog.

## Datadog

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing
monitoring of servers, database, tools, and services, through a Saas-based data
analytics platform. I joined the Logs Hot Storage Team at Datadog in November 2019. 
Our team owns the logs indexing and storage underpinning the Datadog logs
management application. We build, scale, and operate some of the high-volume
data systems that power the growth of Datadog's business.

</p>

In the last two months, besides the onboarding process, I mainly worked on two
topics: data export and logs filtering. Let me explain a bit in the next paragraphs.

Data export. For internal analytics purposes, we need to export data from our
internal system to AWS S3.
It requires some knowledge about AWS such as S3 bucket policy, IAM role. The most
tricky part is testing because I don't have permission to perform the
changes myself. Therefore, it requires a cross-team collaboration to make it
work. 

Logs filtering. Datadog stores your logs in different indexes via index filters
([documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/indexes/)). Index filters give
dynamic control over what goes into your indexes. However, you may not want to
save 100% of your logs. You may only want some of them for troubleshooting
purposes. In this case, you can define an exclusion filter to exclude a given
percentage. The exclusion is based on message ID. Currently, I'm working
on a new feature that allows you to exclude based on other criteria. For now,
I cannot give more detail now but it's an interesting feature. In regards to
implementation, it modifies the data models in RESTful API and persistence;
it requires architectural changes; modification on hashing and sampling
algorithm; benchmark about performance since millions of logs passed every
second; and thinking about deployment (how to lower the risk for customers in
case of incidents).

## Vavr

VAVR (formerly called Javaslang) is a non-commercial, non-profit
object-functional library that runs with Java 8+. It aims to reduce the lines of
code and increase code quality. It brings different Scala concepts into Java such
as control structures (`Option`, `Either`, `Try`, ...) and purely functional
collections (`List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Array`, ...). They are immutable,
type-safe, and interchangeable with builtin Java types. This library makes
exception handling and Java collection usage easier, more concise, and more
robust.

This year, I contributed mainly to VAVR Core and VAVR Jackson to help the
community. I first started writing blog posts and using VAVR myself. Then I
continued on improving documentation and now handle bug-fixing. The most
interesting part of supporting open-source software is the chance to work with
other engineers outside of your company and see how other code-base works. It is
also nice to see your work being used by other developers.

If you were interested in using Vavr, you can visit the [official
website](https://www.vavr.io/), read the [Vavr User
Guide](https://www.vavr.io/vavr-docs/), or chat with the community at
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/vavr-io/vavr).
Actually, I also contributed to other communities, such as
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/commits?author=mincong-h),
[Debezium](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/commits?author=mincong-h),
[Apache Commons
CLI](https://github.com/apache/commons-cli/commits?author=mincong-h). Due
to time constraints, I cannot share more here.

## Blogging

This year, many of you visited my blog. There are 149k users with 187k
page views. The traffic has increased by more than 600% compared to 2018. This is a
huge accomplishment: I feel honored to share my technical journey with you
and bring added value to your daily work. In 2019, 41 blog posts have been
written: mainly focus on Java, Maven, Testing, and Git. My secret about blog
writing is to keep delivery at a fixed pace: writing a blog post
every week or every two weeks. It will make a big difference in the long term.

However, the existing model is not perfect. There are many improvements to do.
For example, compared to 2018 (orange), the average of session duration in
2019 (blue) dropped significantly. In 2020, I plan to write fewer articles and
keep improving the existing one, so that they will be up-to-date. In other
words, they won't be "one-shot" production but will be maintained over time.

## Conclusion

In this article, I shared briefly my working experience at Nuxeo and Datadog in 2019
as a software engineer working for SaaS applications,
my contributions for VAVR, a famous object-functional library for Java 8+, and
finally, some analytics about this technical blog. Interested to know more?
