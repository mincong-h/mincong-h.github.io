The target audience of this document is prospects who are interested in hiring me as a freelancer for consulting service. They run Elasticsearch as a cluster and want to better understand their documents or queries. They have difficulties to troubleshoot the queries. They don't understand why the search results don't match their expectation, and they don't know how to improve.
