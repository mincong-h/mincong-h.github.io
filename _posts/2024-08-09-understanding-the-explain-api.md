The target audience of this document is prospects who are interested in hiring me as a freelancer for consulting service. They run Elasticsearch as a cluster and want to better understand their documents or queries. They have difficulties to troubleshoot the queries. They don't understand why the search results don't match their expectation, and they don't know how to improve.

## Introduction

Elasticsearch is a complex search engine. It has a lot of capabilities under the hook. When you enter a query, you may find the results irrelevant to your query. It seems obvious that some documents should be part of the result, or they should be ranked higher in the list. However, you are frustrated about the ranking, or even worse, you don't see what you want in the list. In this article, we are going discuss the Explain API of Elasticsearch and see how it can help you troubleshoot the read path of your system.

After reading this article, you will understand:

* Why do you want to use the Explain API?
* What does it show you in the HTTP response?
* The scoring algorithm BM25
* Other considerations around troubleshooting
