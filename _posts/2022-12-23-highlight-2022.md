## Introduction

Writing an article for an annual review becomes a tradition for me. After
writing for 6 consecutive years
([link](/en/categories/review/)), I decided to continue this year, to share with
you my journey in the tech industry, as a software engineer at Datadog and as an
explorer for other side-projects during my free time. Hopefully, they will let
you learn something or inspire you to create your story. Now, let's get started!

## Datadog

I joined Datadog at the end of 2019 as a software engineer working for the Event
Platform. This year, I was part of the automation team, which improves the site
reliability, reduces toil and facilitates engineer's daily work. My
contributions can be resumed as the 4 major parts:

* **Operation workflows.** Developing operation-related workflows which create
  or delete complext data pipelines or data stores. Before these workflows, we
  had to create or delete them manually, which was complex and time-consuming.
  By using workflows, we can achieve them in an easier way and provide
  contextual actions based on the user's requirements.
* **Automation safety.** To ensure the automation can be performed safely, I
  also developed a verification process, which collects data in different
  dimensions and makes decisions so that administrators can determine whether
  the automation can be performed or should be postponed.
* **Automation utilities.** Writing workflows can be very complex. We need
  different utilities to faciliate the development. This year, I developed a
  service SDK, some frontend integratin, custom release mechanism, an analytics
  helper, templates, and some other tools to faciliate the development for other
  engineers. A good example was that a junior was able to create a new workflow
  in less than 2 days during his hackathon project, which was pretty cool!
* **Other works.** There are also other contributions made in different aspects:
  cross-team collobarations, being an interviewer, being interrupt handler (IH),
  being on call, participate to RFC review and code review, and more.

For the coming year, I wish I can support the growth of the platform and other
storage systems by bringing more solutions related to SRE and automation.
