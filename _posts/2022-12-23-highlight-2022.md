## Introduction

Writing an article for an annual review becomes a tradition for me. After
writing for 6 consecutive years
([link](/en/categories/review/)), I decided to continue this year, to share with
you my journey in the tech industry, as a software engineer at Datadog and as an
explorer for other side-projects during my free time. Hopefully, they will let
you learn something or inspire you to create your story. Now, let's get started!

## Datadog

I joined Datadog at the end of 2019 as a software engineer working for the Event
Platform. This year, I was part of the automation team, which improves the site
reliability, reduces toil and facilitates engineer's daily work. My
contributions can be resumed as the 4 major parts:

* **Operation workflows.** Developing operation-related workflows which create
  or delete complex data pipelines or data stores. Before these workflows, we
  had to create or delete them manually, which was complex and time-consuming.
  By using workflows, we can achieve them in an easier way and provide
  contextual actions based on the user's requirements.
* **Automation safety.** To ensure the automation can be performed safely, I
  also developed a verification process, which collects data in different
  dimensions and makes decisions so that administrators can determine whether
  the automation can be performed or should be postponed.
* **Automation utilities.** Writing workflows can be very complex. We need
  different utilities to faciliate the development. This year, I developed a
  service SDK, some frontend integratin, custom release mechanism, an analytics
  helper, templates, and some other tools to faciliate the development for other
  engineers. A good example was that a junior was able to create a new workflow
  in less than 2 days during his hackathon project, which was pretty cool!
* **Other works.** There are also other contributions made in different aspects:
  cross-team collobarations, being an interviewer, being interrupt handler (IH),
  being on call, participate to RFC review and code review, and more.

The main difference compared to last year is that I was more involved in
system-level development.
For the coming year, I want to support the growth of the platform and other
storage systems by bringing more solutions related to SRE and automation. To
achieve this, there are improvements to do for system understanding, software
design, delivery speed, team colloborations, communication, and more.

## Blog

This year I put less energy in blog writing and focused more on my daily work. The
blog was mainly about system design (5 posts), but I also wrote some
articles related to workflow automation, documentation, and API design. These
posts are related to what I learned from my work since I had the chance to
develop a new automation solution for internal usage.

To improve the user experience, I developed several new features for
my blog: rebranding the home page, adding the search capability, and introducing
the post id. This wasnâ€™t easy because each feature requires some work: for the
home page, I need to get some inspiration from other websites, modify the Jekyll
template and adjust some CSS. As for the search feature, I needed to set up a
search service with Java and Elasticsearch, and I also needed to integrate with
Datadog. But I loved this site project as it is useful for other developers and
helped me to gain more experience in development and operations.

Whatâ€™s next? Last year I was too ambitious so this year I want to keep it simple
ðŸ˜€ I hope that I can keep a stable delivery cadence, e.g. having 17 posts next
year (1 post every 3 weeks) and with focus on one or two main topics, e.g.
microservices, automation, or system design. Also, I want to share these posts
to Medium so that more people can subscribe easily.

## Finance

[Finance toolkit](https://github.com/mincong-h/finance-toolkit/) is a small
library helping you to understand your personal financial situation by
extracting, transforming, and aggregating transactions from different companies
into a single place. The companies supported are: BNP Paribas, Boursorama,
Revolut, and some others. It generates CSV files that can be used for data
visualization. It was created in 2019 and written in Python by Jingwen Zheng and
I, with some help from MickaÃ«l Schoentgen. This year, we improved the Revolut
integration, added support for multiple currencies (EUR, USD), brought some
technical improvements (e.g. logging, testing, error handling), and open-sourced
the project on GitHub. This tool helped us increase our savings by XX% over the
last 3 years.
