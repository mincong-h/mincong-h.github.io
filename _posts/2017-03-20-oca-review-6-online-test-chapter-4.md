Today, I'm going to review my online test, chapter 4 of Oracle Certified
Associate (OCA), provided by SYBEX. If you need to access to this online
resources, you need to buy their book first. See

## Question 5

Given the following method, which of the method calls return `2`? (Choose all
that apply)

{% highlight java %}
public int howMany(boolean b, boolean... b2) {
  return b2.length;
}
{% endhighlight %}

1. `howMany();`
2. `howMany(true);`
3. `howMany(true, true);`
4. `howMany(true, true, true);`
5. `howMany(true, {true});`
6. `howMany(true, {true, true});`
7. `howMany(true, new boolean[2]);`

**The answer is DG.** The answer A is wrong because it does not match the types
of input parameters, the code does not compile. The answer B is wrong because it
creates a vararg of size 0. The answer C returns 1. The answer D return 2 which
is correct. The answer E and F do not compile because they do not declare an
array properly, e.g. it should be `new boolean[] {true}` for answer E. The
answer G is correct, which creates an empty array with 2 elements. The tricky
thing here is the _"Anonymous Array"_ as `{ ... }` without the word `new`. This
 is anonymous because you don't specify the type and size. However, it is only
allowed in initialization as the following:

{% highlight java %}
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}; // OK

for (int i : {1, 2, 3}) {  // Does not compile!
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Question 6

Which of the following are true? (choose all that apply)

1. Package private access is more lenient than protected access.
2. A `public` class that has private fields and package private methods is not
visible to classes outside the package.
3. You can use access modifiers so only some of the classes in a package see a
particular package private class.
4. You can use access modifiers to allow read access to all methods, but not any
instance variable.
5. You can use access modifiers to restrict read access to all classes that
begin with the word `Test`.

**The answer is D.** The answer A is wrong because package private access is
less lenient than protected access: package private means that only classes
within the same package call use this method, while protected access means that
classes within the same package, or classes extended the target class can see
this method. The answer B is wrong, because a public class is visible outside of
the package regardless the visibility of its methods. The answer C is wrong,
because package private access applies to the whole package. The answer E is
wrong because Java does not have such capability. The answer D is correct, this
approach is used for all the immutable classes.

## Question 7

Given the following `my.school.Classroom` and `my.city.School` class
definitions, which line numbers in `main()` generate a compiler error? (Choose
all that apply)

{% highlight java linenos %}
package my.school;

public class Classroom {
  private int roomNumber;
  protected String teacherName;
  static int globalKey = 54321;
  public int floor = 3;

  Classroom(int r, String t) {
    roomNumber = r;
    teacherName = t;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos %}
package my.city;

import my.school.*;

public class School {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(Classroom.globalKey);
    Classroom room = new Classroom(101, "Mrs. Anderson");
    System.out.println(room.roomNumber);
    System.out.println(room.floor);
    System.out.println(room.teacherName);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

1. None, the code compiles fine.
2. Line 8
3. Line 9
4. Line 10
5. Line 11
6. Line 12

**The answer is BCDF.** The answer B is wrong because `globalKey` has package
private access, the main method cannot see this variable. The answer C is wrong
for the same reason, the constructor is package private, so it is not visible
for the main method. The answer D is private, so invisible for main method. The
answer E is correct because `floor` is public. The answer E is incorrect because
teach's name is protected, only sub-classes of classroom, or any class in the
same package can see this variable.

## Question 12

What is the output of the following code?

{% highlight java %}
import static rope.Rope.*;
import rope.*;

public class RopeSwing {

  private static Rope rope1 = new Rope();
  private static Rope rope2 = new Rope();

  {
    System.out.println(repo1.length);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    rope1.length = 2;
    rope2.length = 8;
    System.out.println(rope1.length);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
package rope;

public class Rope {
  public static int length = 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

1. `02`
2. `08`
3. `2`
4. `8`
5. The code does not compile.
6. An exception is thrown.

**The answer is D.** The class `RopeSwing` has an instance initializer and not a
static initializer. However, the class `RopeSwing` is never constructed, so the
method `System.out.println(repo1.length);` is never called. Since the length is
a static variable, repo 1 and repo 2 update the same variable.

## Question 17

Which of the following are output by the following code? (Choose all that apply)

{% highlight java %}
public class StringBuilders {
  public static StringBuilder work(StringBuilder a, StringBuilder b) {
    a = new StringBuilder("a");
    b.append("b");
    return a;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringBuilder s1 = new StringBuilder("s1");
    StringBuilder s2 = new StringBuilder("s2");
    StringBuilder s3 = work(s1, s2);
    System.out.println("s1 = " + s1);
    System.out.println("s2 = " + s2);
    System.out.println("s3 = " + s3);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

1. `s1 = a`
2. `s1 = s1`
3. `s2 = s2`
4. `s2 = s2b`
5. `s3 = a`
6. `s3 = null`
7. The code does not compile.

**The answer is BDE.** Since Java is pass-by-value, assigning a new object to
`a` des not change the caller, so B is correct. However, calling the method of
the same reference does affect the caller, so D is correct. Finally, the method
`work` returns a reference of string builder containing a character "a", so E is
correct.
