## Overview

Today I want to share the Java framework
["Immutables"](https://immutables.github.io/) with you. Immutables generate
simple, safe and consistent value objects for you. Thanks to Immutables, you
don't need to implement hashcode, equals, toString anymore.
After reading this article, you will understand:

- How to use Immutables in Maven project
- How to create a value class using Immutables
- How to create an instance
- How to modify an instance
- Support for optional
- Support for collection
- How to integrate with Jackson for JSON serialization
- How to go further on this topic

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Declare the following dependency in your Maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.immutables</groupId>
  <artifactId>value</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.2</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

In Maven, declaring a dependency as "provided" means this dependency is only for
compilation and won't be required at runtime. This is the case for Immutables
because it is only used for generating the immutables classes during compilation.

## Create Value Class

Once the dependency is added, you can create your value class now. This can be
done by declaring an interface or abstract class with your desired accessor
methods. For example, creating a User class with name, emails, and an optional
description can be done as follows:

```java
package io.mincong.immutables;

import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Set;
import org.immutables.value.Value;

@Value.Immutable
public interface User {

  String name();

  Set<String> emails();

  Optional<String> description();

}
```

Since we declare the annotation `@Value.Immutable` in the interface, Immutables
will recognize this class as value class and generate an immutable
implementation using an annotation processor during compilation. The generated
class will be located in the same package "io.mincong.immutables" with prefix
"Immutable\*", i.e. `io.mincong.immutables.ImmutableUser`. The naming convention is:

```sh
Immutable${MyClass}
```

Now, you can use it as:

```java
var user =
    ImmutableUser.builder()
        .name("Tom")
        .emails(List.of("tom@foo.com", "tom@bar.com"))
        .description("Welcome to Immutables")
        .build();
// User{name=Tom, emails=[tom@foo.com, tom@bar.com], description=Welcome to Immutables}
```

By the way, you cannot provide null as reference by default. When giving `null`
to builder, it will raise a null pointer exception:

> java.lang.NullPointerException: name

Therefore, once the object is created by Immutables, you know that you are safe
to retrieve any field. You don't need to worry about about null.

## Modify An Instance

The objects created by Immutables are immutable, you cannot modify them. The
fields are read-only. However, you can create a new object based on the existing
one, either using the factory methods "with\*" or using a builder.

```java
// Create a new object using method "with{Field}"
var user2 = user.withName("Thomas");
// User{name=Thomas, emails=[tom@foo.com, tom@bar.com], description=Welcome to Immutables}
```

```java
// Create a new object using builder
var user2 = ImmutableUser.builder().from(user).name("Thomas").build();
// User{name=Thomas, emails=[tom@foo.com, tom@bar.com], description=Welcome to Immutables}
```

The first approach is handy for changing one or two fields. The second approach
is handy for changing more fields.

## Benefits

Before going further, let's discuss what are the benefits of using Immutables we
discovered so far. There are several points: generated methods, immutability,
and null-safety.

**Generated methods.** Let's talk about generated equals, generated hash-code, and generated
to-string. Methods `equals()` and `hashCode()` is generated by Immutable, so
that you don't have to handle them yourself. It means that whenever a field is
added, changed, or deleted, the implementation of equals and hashCode are
generated again at the next compilation. It keeps the equals and hashCode
consistent and up-to-date. This is the same for `toString()` method. Also,
delegating the implementation to Immutables increase to readability: there is
no boilerplate methods stored in your source code.

**Immutable.** All the fields are immutable, regardless they are primitives, objects,
or collections. Immutable objects are always in a consistent state and can be
safely shared. They are thread-safe. This is particularly useful when writing
high-concurrency applications or storing values in the cache.

**Null-safe.** Immutables check the mandatory attributes for you and fail the
validation during creation-time. So there is no worry at read-time. For nullable
objects, Immutables also provides supports for it, e.g. using Optional.

## Builder

Now, let's continue our exploration of Immutables on the builder side.
Behind the screen, Immutables processor creates a builder for each value class,
such as `ImmutableUser.Builder` for our value class `User`. Builder class is
very powerful, here are some features that I want to discuss: support for
collection, support for optional.

For collection objects, such as Set or List, Immutable builder provides several
methods to help you manage them (see code snippet below). Thanks to these
methods, it is easy to set the value for a collection in one
call or do it incrementally. And having two overloaded methods
with interface `Iterable<T>` and varargs `T...` makes it possible to fill the
values with almost all kinds of collections and array.

```
Builder#emails(Iterable<String> elements)
Builder#addAllEmails(Iterable<String> elements)
Builder#addEmails(String element)
Builder#addEmails(String... elements)
```

For optional objects, such as `Optional<String>` declared in your value class, it
creates two overloaded methods for you in the builder, one accepts an optional
and the other accepts a normal String:

```
Builder#description(String description)
Builder#description(Optional<String> description)
```

I won't cover more features here. If you were interested, you can go to
[Immutables' user guide](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html), there
are "strict builder", "staged builder", etc.

## Jackson Support

In the real-world, working with value classes in Java often means exchanging
information with REST APIs and databases. One popular exchange format is JSON.
We can see it everywhere: REST APIs, Elastichsearch, MongoDB, ... Therefore,
it's important to know how immutables can support it. Here I'm taking Jackson as
an example because it is one of the most popular frameworks for JSON serialization
in the Java ecosystem.

Overall Jackson does not require any serious code generation to be flexible and
highly performant on the JVM. Using the classical Jackson dependencies
(annotations, core, databind) and the already-included dependency of Immutables
(`org.immutables:value:2.8.3`), you are ready for the JSON serialization. In
your value class, add annotations `@JsonSerialize` and `@JsonDeserialize` to delegate
the serialization and deserialization to Immutables. If the JSON property is the
same as your Java field, you can omit the explicit `@JsonProperty`. Otherwise,
you need to specify it for the field mapping:

```diff
 @Value.Immutable
+@JsonSerialize(as = ImmutableAddress.class)
+@JsonDeserialize(as = ImmutableAddress.class)
 public interface Address {

   String address();

   String city();

+  @JsonProperty("zipcode")
   String postalCode();

 }
```

Then, use it as:

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
var elysee =
    ImmutableAddress.builder()
        .address("55 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré")
        .city("Paris")
        .postalCode("75008")
        .build();
var json = mapper.writeValueAsString(elysee);
```

```json
{
  "address": "55 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré",
  "city": "Paris",
  "zipcode": "75008"
}
```

Note that this is not the only way to configure Immutables for Jackson.
Other ways can be reached here in the
[official documentation about JSON](https://immutables.github.io/json.html).
There, you can also find support for other frameworks for JSON serialization.
