## Introduction

The service client of Temporal is the key component for talking to the Temporal
server, it's built on top of gPRC. Today, I want to discuss the
internal working of Temporal service client with you so that we can better
understand how does it work, help us for troubleshooting, and get some
inspiration for similar implementations.

In this article, we will talk about:

* the package structure of the service client
* the API contracts in protobuf
* the code generation
* the data conversion
* the authorization
* and how to go further from this article

This article is written based on Temporal Java SDK v1.16. Now, let's get started!
