    Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) reduces the coupling between
    application and logging framework. It support various logging frameworks as
    bindings. In this article, I will explain what is SLF4J, why and how to use
    it.

## Overview

Logging is an important part of an application. Today, I would like to share
my understanding about the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J).
After reading this article, you will understand:

- What is SLF4J
- Why using SLF4J
- How to use it
- Choose the binding

The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) is a simple facade for logging
frameworks. It allows you to log events from your client code, without knowing
the actual implementation of the logging system. The underlying logging backend
is determined at runtime by adding the desired binding to the classpath.

```
Client --> SLF4J API --> SLF4J Impl
```

## Why using SLF4J

**Loose coupling.** The separation of the client API from the logging framework
reduces the coupling between an application and any particular logging
framework. It makes integration easier with projects or third-party code that
have already chosen their own logging backend.

**Rich binding choices.** There're multiple implementation (binding)
choices: Java logging package (`java.util.logging`), Log4J, No Operation (NOP),
Simple, Jakarta Commons Logging, and Logback. You can choose the one you want at
deployment time. More detail will be described in the binding section.

**Popularity.** In 2016, SLF4J API (`slf4j-api`) is the 2nd of the most popular
Java frameworks based on [OverOps's
analysis](https://blog.overops.com/the-top-100-java-libraries-in-2016-after-analyzing-47251-dependencies/)
on GitHub.

## SLF4J Demo

In this section, we will see how to use SLF4J in your source code.
If you're using Maven, you need to include the SLF4J API as dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.26</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, in the source code, you need to create a logger from Logger Factory
(`LoggerFactory`). After that, you can log the desired messages.
`org.slf4j.Logger` provides multiple log methods based on log levels: trace,
debug, info, warn, and error. You can log a simple Java string, or a format
string with arguments, or an exception (throwable). Here's an example using a
format string, where the user is injected as an argument.

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyService {

  private static final Logger logger =
      LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);

  public void sayHi(String user) {
    logger.info("Hi, {}", user);
  }
}
```

The placeholder `{}` is something special in SLF4J. It is also called
"parameterized message". It provides a fast way of logging: if the log statement
is disabled, the value will not be evaluated. It's equivalent to log statement
surrounded by if-statement, but in a less verbose way. It is at least 30 times
faster in case of disabled logging statement, according to [SLF4J
FAQ](https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance).

```java
// 1. No evaluation
logger.info("Hi, " + user);
```

```java
// 2. Evaluation
if (logger.isInfoEnabled()) {
  logger.info("Hi, " + user);
}
```

```java
// 3. Smart evaluation (SLF4J)
//    (30x faster than N.1)
logger.info("Hi, {}", user);
```

## Choosing Binding

SLF4J supports various logging frameworks. The SLF4J distribution provides
several JAR files as "SLF4J bindings", with each binding corresponding to one
supported framework.

**Simple Logger** (`slf4j-simple`). Binding for Simple implementation, which
outputs all events to `System.err`. Only messages of level INFO and higher are
printed. This binding may be useful in the context of small applications.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.26</version>
</dependency>
```

**Log4J Logger** (`slf4j-log4j12`). Binding for log4j version 1.2, a widely used logging
framework. You also need to place log4j.jar on your class path.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.26</version>
</dependency>
```

**JDK Logger** (`slf4j-jdk14`). Binding for `java.util.logging`, also referred
to as JDK 1.4 logging.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.26</version>
</dependency>
```

**Jakarta Commons Logging** (`slf4j-jcl`). Binding for Jakarta Commons Logging.
This binding will delegate all SLF4J logging to JCL.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-jcl</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.26</version>
</dependency>
```

**Logback Logging** (`logback-classic` and `logback-core`). There are also SLF4J
bindings external to the SLF4J project, e.g. logback which implements SLF4J
natively. Logback's ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger class is a direct
implementation of SLF4J's org.slf4j.Logger interface. Thus, using SLF4J in
conjunction with logback involves strictly zero memory and computational
overhead.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

> Please let me know if you have troubles using these dependencies.

From [SLF4J Manual](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html), there's graphical
illustration of the general idea about the concrete bindings. I found it very
useful and straight forward:

## Conclusion

In this article, we learnt the basic about the Simple Logging Facade for Java
(SLF4J), the motivation of using this framework (loose coupling and multiple
bindings), how to use it in the source code, and finally, the possible bindings
for the API. Hope you enjoy this article, see you the next time!
