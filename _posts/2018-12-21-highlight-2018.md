## Overview

Time flies and already another year passes. Today, I'd like to share with you
my year 2018. Here's the summary section:

- Works at Nuxeo (long)
- Stack Overflow
- Chrome extension
- Open source projects
- Blog
- Personal finance

In 2018, I handled 144 tickets for Nuxeo. They are very different and require
many skills. Most of them are related to Nuxeo Online Services, including Nuxeo
Studio, Nuxeo Connect Dashboard, Nuxeo Marketplace. There's also Nuxeoctl, a
command line tool for Nuxeo Server. It's challenging to handle them as a Junior
Software Engineer, but I'm grateful that my teammates trust me and that
everything moves smoothly. Now, let's take a look at Nuxeo Studio.

## Nuxeo Studio

[Nuxeo Studio](https://doc.nuxeo.com/studio/)
lets you configure your Nuxeo platform easily. Nuxeo Studio is
part of the product of Nuxeo Online Servies, hosted on the cloud. It provides
a GUI to allow you customize your Nuxeo instances quickly, and create
application without having to write a single line of code. Here're some changes
I brought this year.

**Feature Configurations.** Improve UI/UX experience by changing the CSS and
the UI components written in GWT. Add supports for new features in generation
and provide bug fixes for different editors.

- Page Provider Editor. Various bug fixes on complex multi-valued field, for
  ElasticSearch, field resolution, field binding. Also adding support for new
  NXQL syntax `ecm:isTrashed`.
- Workflow Editor. Add support for validation form. So that people can now cancel a
  workflow even if the validation fails.
- Schemas Editor. Support generation for `idOnly` and `pathOnly`.
- JavaScript Editors. Change editor settings for users, to provide better
  user experience for writing code.

**Branch Management.** Display Maven coordinates in branch listing view. Always
display the current branch as the first result. Improve feedback when tag name
already exists. Show user workspace state on the top of commit history (a.k.a
work-in-progress commits). For more detail about Branch Management, check the
[documentation page](https://doc.nuxeo.com/studio/branch-management/) and our
[tutorials](https://doc.nuxeo.com/studio/tutorials/).

**Quick Switcher** is a new feature of Nuxeo Studio. It allows you to quick
switch between feature: jump into any Nuxeo Studio feature or menu option by
typing its name, or just a few characters. The action can be triggered by
clicking the button, or using shortcut « CTRL + K » in Windows/Linux or « CMD +
K » in Mac. I was responsible for most part of the implementation on the UI
part using [Polymer 2](https://www.polymer-project.org/), and part of the REST
API on the backend. For more detail, check my blog [How Quick Switcher is
implemented?](/2018/10/18/how-quick-switcher-is-implemented/)

</p>

**Internal changes.** Every feature configured in Studio will be generated as
XML and be able to downloaded as JAR or ZIP. This year, I contributed to
builder factoring, to inverse builder / platform relationship, refactor the
builder resolver, and create new builder extension points (Java) and
contributions (XML).

## Nuxeo Connect Dashboard

**REST API**. Create REST API resources for different purposes: project
management, client / organization management, and administration. The goal is to
deprecate and remove FreeMarker, and use REST APIs to communicate between
client and server.

**Security and Authentication**. On the security side, I contributed to some
Content Security Policy (CSP) changes and fix several XSS vulnerabilities. On
the authentication side, I upgraded our Central Authentication Service (CAS) and
did some improvements on post filtering when after user login.

**Performance**. Improve the performance of applications listing, time reduced
from 1.3 min to 1.83 second. This is done by reducing time complexity from
O(N^2) to O(N). Also, another improvement on files by using Guava Loading Cache.

## Nuxeo Marketplace

There're relatively fewer tasks in Marketplace compared to other components. My
contributions are around registries management (migrated from Studio) and REST
API creation for platform / package management. Also some task for UI / UX
improvement.

## Other Topics in Nuxeo

       alt="Git logo">
</p>

**Git Server** in NOS has been changed this year. We usually used GitLab
Server to store customer projects. But we realized that this solution does not
completely fit to our needs: we don't need metadata (issues, PRs) provided by
GitLab and we don't want users to access our GitLab website directly. Therefore,
a series of security measures need to be developped and maintained. It's a pain.
The only need we have is to store the Git repositories. By consequence, we
swtiched to our own Git Server « Gitty », an implementation based on JGit
Server and Jersey. My contributions are principally around:

- Migration from GitLab to Gitty
- RESTful API for repository CRUD
- RESTful API served as "template" for other REST applications
- Git restriction on different Git operations and user roles
- Improve testability by adding Gitty into functional tests

**Google Analytics** integration has been improved. Firstly, provide the opt-out
option for user in regards to GDPR. Secondly, refactor the categorization for
pages and events, so that they are meaningful and easy to maintain. I also added
analytics for new features and some of the existing ones, so that we can better
understand user behavior. Note that we have several frontend technologies: GWT /
FreeMarker / Polymer. The analytics integration is handled in each of them.

**Testing** is might be the place where I spent most of the time. This
part has been well improved this year. Some key changes:

- Improve existing test logic
- Upgrade functional tests: Selenium 2 to 3, Firefox 42 to 58
- Test trial registration (with SMTP server started)
- Test Polymer element using Web Component Tester (WCT)
- Test GWT changes using GWT tests (GWT Maven Plugin)
- Introduce a new Java annotation `@Tester` for integration tests

**Build Tools** have been well improved this year too. This year, I contributed
to the [Git repositories merge](/2018/11/06/merging-git-repositories/), Maven
plugins refactoring, adding new Maven plugins for different purposes: license
check, code-style check, code usage check, code quality etc. Also some changes
on deployment, release, Jenkins job configuration, and docker image.

## Nuxeoctl

The [nuxeoctl](https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/nuxeoctl-and-control-panel-usage/)
script is located in the `bin` folder of the Nuxeo Server. It enables various
options and commands. For MS Windows users, its equivalent is the
`nuxeoctl.bat` script. This year, I did not work much on this component, only 4
tickets:

- [NXP-24507](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-24507) Remember changes when `nuxeoctl` restarted
- [NXP-24671](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-24671) Install package using package id rather than package name
- [NXP-24121](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-24121) Fix Strict mode in start background command `startbg`
- [NXP-24151](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-24151) Add (nuxeoctl) status to systemd init script

## StackOverflow

I asked 39 questions on StackOverflow this year. This
[query](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/951634/how-many-upvotes-do-i-have-for-each-tag-this-year?Year=2018&UserId=4381330)
shows how many up-votes do I have for each tag in 2018. The top 10 results are:
`java (34)`, `git (11)`, `datetime (7)`, `jgit (6)`, `xml (6)`, `maven (5)`,
`mvn-repo (4)`, `nio (4)`, `apache (4)`, `json (3)`. At the beginning of the
year, I was very interested in answering questions on StackOverflow. But then I
realized that the high-score users are not just "hard-worker", they have
[first-move advantage
(MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage) over others.
Also, unlike JavaScript or Cloud technologies, Java is very mature: many
questions have already been asked and answered. So I gave up more-or-less the
game, and moved the focus on other fields.

## Chrome Extension

I created a Chrome extension
[Ads Eraser](https://github.com/mincong-h/chrome-extensions/tree/master/action-ads-eraser)
for erasing ads in one click:

## Open Source Projects

Here's a list of open source projects that I contributed to this year. All
patches are actually very small ones. Actually, I would like to contribute
more if there's any opportunity, but it's hard. Contribution requires expertise
but it's hard to have it in the daily work. Perhaps it will be easier when
experience grows...

  for GWT 3

## Blog

This year, many of you visited my blog. The traffic has increased 12 times
compared to 2017. 49 articles have been created, for Java, Maven, Git, REST API,
GWT and more. I'm really happy that you enjoyed them and hope that I can bring
more values to you in the next year. If you're curious about the secret behind
the traffic growth, check my blog: [Improve Blog Ranking in Google
Search](/2018/07/21/improve-the-search-presence/).

</p>

Next year, I plan to improve the blog style to let it more user friendly. For
example, provide related resources in the post, so user can jump between posts
easier; write more series about Java; provide some book recommendations for
becoming a good software engineer; improve the feed settings to improve reading
experience.

## Personal Finance

I made a small application with my wife for better handling personal finance.
It is based on Python / Google Sheet / Jupyter Notebook. It helps us to keep
track of our expense by downloading transaction history from our bank and
aggregate them into different files. For more information, you can see my blog
[Personal Finance: Data
Collection](/2018/10/25/personal-finance-data-collection/).

## Java Certification

I passed the certification of Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8
Programmer this year. You can see my digital certification
[here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/3c1f8db6-497a-4460-9603-eac47f218127/).

## Conclusion

Hope you enjoy this article, see you the next time!
