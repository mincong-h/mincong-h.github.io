Today, I'd like to share with you the review of year 2017. Here's the topics
that I would like to talk about.

- Chrome extensions
- Hibernate Search: JSR-352 integration
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Code Quality and Sonar
- Oracle Java certifications
- Git Understanding
- Stack Overflow
- Improve Efficiency
- Reading Books

## Chrome Extensions

<p align="center" style="margin: 2rem auto 1rem auto">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/logo-chrome.png"

       style="max-height: 50px" />
</p>

I created three Chrome extensions to learn JavaScript basics and make life
easier. They're actually very small extensions, but quite helpful. I use them
everyday:

1. **action-news** is an action extension to see yesterday's news «20 Heures» on
  https://www.tf1.fr. Because the URL is written in French, and a sub-path of
  it varies between weekdays and weekends, so I wrote an extension to detect the
  URL correctly.
2. **action-nuxeo** is an action extension to open all the important tabs for my
  daily work at Nuxeo in one click, including the Slack, GitHub, and Gmail.
  Therefore, I don't need to open them one-by-one.
3. **action-stackoverflow** is an action extension to open all the tag
  combination that I'm interested on Stack Overflow. It helps to better filter
  the questions where I can answer, so earning reputation is easier. For
  example, the combination of ( `java`, `date` ), ( `java`, `list` ).

The source code is available on GitHub:
[mincong-h/chrome-extensions][chrome-extensions]

## Hibernate Search

My Google Summer of Code project, [Hibernate Search: JSR 352 Integration][gsoc]
is finally merged into Hibernate Search, and released as part of Hibernate
Search [5.9.0.Beta1][5.9.0.Beta1]. This integration provides an alternative to
the existing mass indexer. Compared to the existing indexer, it is:

- Easy to understand, as workflow is described in XML.
- Free to choose your Java batch platform, e.g. [JBeret][jberet],
  [JBatch][jbatch], or [Sprint Batch][spring-batch] (coming soon).
- Restartable from the last checkpoint.

The source code is available on GitHub: [hibernate/hibernate-search][hsearch]

## Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is my favorite development process. I like writing
short, comprehensive, and fast-to-execute unit tests during the development. It
brings you full of confidence for no matter what changes you make. For all of my
personal projects on GitHub, I linked them to Travis CI so that tests are
executed at each commit-push.

As for software development at company, the process is harder. You need to
convince your teammates for doing the same thing. And the process becomes
unbelievably complex face to a legacy codebase. You need to know many things
before going further. And my current techniques are:

- If task can be done in less then 30 min, don't ask opinions, do it.
- Always look for quick win in tests.
- Use code analysis tools to drive your decision.
- Split long tests into small ones, with one objective per test.
- Prefer unit tests than integration tests.
- Use AssertJ which is more fluent then JUnit.

In 2017, I added two modules for testing in company, and improved the
test coverage and tests' quality.

## Code Quality and Sonar

<p align="center" style="margin: 2rem auto 1.6rem auto">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/logo-sonarsource.svg"
       alt="Logo SonarSource"
       style="max-height: 40px">
</p>

Code quality is very important for software development. After some discussion
with my friends [Kevin][kg] and [Kevin][kp] :) , I decided to use [Sonar][sonar]
to improve the code quality for both company's projects (Nuxeo Studio, Nuxeo
Connect) and my personal projects. For company projects, Sonar plugin is
integrated with QA platform Jenkins, and is being triggered when commits get
merged into _master_ branch. Meanwhile, Sonar is integrated as a Maven profile,
which can be used on-demand, and is excluded by default by other jobs, like
release jobs. For personal projects, I used Travis CI instead of Jenkins. The
integration is slightly easier, as documented by the official Travis CI blog
post: [Using SonarCloud with Travis CI][sonar-travis].

- Company projects: SonarCloud + Jenkins
- Personal projects: SonarCloud + Travis CI

Since the Sonar integration, I felt that everybody in the team is more involved
in the code quality process. By working together, we have already some
improvements on different code-bases in regards to bugs, vulnerabilities, and
code smells. In order to facilitate the usage, we also use SonarLint in both
[Eclipse version][sonar-eclipse] and [IntelliJ version][sonar-intellij], so that
we can see the Sonar issues inside the source code.

## Java Certifications

<p align="center" style="margin: 2rem auto 1.6rem auto">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/logo-java-certif-oca.png"
       alt="Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer"
       style="max-height: 60px">
</p>

I passed the 1st level Java certification: _Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE
8 Programmer_ in April 2017. It's a great experience, and I really enjoyed the
learning process: you need to learn Java in different aspects, such as data
types, encapsulations, collections API, inheritance, exception handling. These
are the _must-have_ skills to be a Java developer.

Now, I'm going one step further—I'm preparing the 2nd level Java certification:
_Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 8_. It includes basic class design,
advanced Java class design, generics and collections, lambda functional
interfaces, stream API, exceptions and assertions, date/time API, file IO, file
NIO, currency, JDBC, and localization. **Edit:** I passed this one on 13th
January, 2018. Really happy that I passed, because it was a
[long preparation][ocp-review].

## Git Understanding

Git is a very important part of our daily development task. No matter you're
coding a new feature, fixing bugs, doing back-port, or releasing a new version,
using Git correctly means you can better collaborate with your teammates in the
Git manner. One year ago, I considered myself as a Git newbie, and I started
reading the book [«Git Pro»][git-pro]. Now, when I looked back, the benefits are
huge. Not only it helps me to understand what is Git, how to use it efficiently,
it also teaches me how to think distributed data in the Git manner. «Git Pro»
also provides [an online edition][git-pro-online] for free, you might want to
start from there.

I wrote 4 blog posts this year for Git:

- [Learning Git Basics]({{ site.url }}/2017/01/20/learning-git-basics/)
- [Setup GitLab Sever Locally]({{ site.url }}/2017/03/10/setup-gitlab-server-locally/)
- [Git Repository Migration]({{ site.url }}/2017/06/01/git-repository-migration/)
- [What Is Git Branch?]({{ site.url }}/2017/10/04/what-is-git-branch/)

And answered some questions on StackOverflow:

- [JGit: read the content of a file at a commit in a branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45793800/)
- [JGit addFilePattern not working for my absolute path to a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45913082/)
- [How to obtain the RevCommit or ObjectId from a SHA1 ID string with
  JGit?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25755475/)

Thanks to all this basics Git understanding, The well-known performance
bottleneck of Nuxeo Studio, the branch listing feature [has been
resolved](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXS-4269), and the biggest project
listing time reduced from 9,735ms → 126ms.

## Stack Overflow

> Why I don't contribute to Stack Overflow anymore?

Using Stack Overflow was aimed to help others and improve my programming skills.
This is a good initiative, but answering questions is not so obvious. In many
times, it's too difficult to provide an answer without digging deep into the
context. Sometimes, question can be marked as duplicate, or can be answered in
5 min just after its creation. The post itself is not always well-explained.

Even though Stack Overflow is extremely useful in reader's point of view, it's
not the best way for developer who want to learn by helping. Now, my preferred
way to learn is to read books, read source codes, and code by myself.

## Improve Efficiency

At the beginning of the year, I was very frustrated by not being able to work as
efficiently as my teammates. Then I tried different methods to make myself more
productive. Here're some techniques that I'd like to share with you.

- Use [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to
  schedule your task
- Think twice, code once
- Make a mistake checklist
- Keep learning
- Automate repetitive tasks

I would say that the most benefit one for me is the pomodoro technique, which
let me understand how many time I've, and how many time I've already spent on
one task. And when should I ask others for help.

## Reading Books

Reading books is my favorite way to learn software. Good books are very
structured and easy to understand. Among the books read, I recommend you the
following ones:

- [The Pragmatic Programmer][pragmatic-programmer]
- [HTTP: The Definitive Guide][http]
- [OCA: Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Guide][oca]
- [OCP: Java SE 7 Programmer II Certification Guide][ocp]
- [Git Pro][git-pro]

«The Pragmatic Programmer» teaches a lot must-have skills of being a good
programmer, including estimation, design, tooling, test, performance and more.
No matter which programming languages you're using, reading this book will let
you become better in you profession. «HTTP: The Definitive Guide» is another
very useful book. It talks about HTTP via real-world scenarios, including the
HTTP message, web server, proxies, caching, authentication, HTTPS,
internationalization and more. The two Java certification books, written by Mala
Gupta, are must-read books for those who want to become a real Java
professional. On one hand, these books are the best resources to help you pass
your certifications, on the other hand, they give detailed and structured
knowledge on _every_ aspect of Java to let you benefit the advantage of each
built-in Java API on your daily work. «Git Pro» let you understand how Git works
and accelerate your Git experience. I used to make a lot of mistakes when using
Git, but after reading this book, I use Git much better and start understanding
the art of Git.

## Goals of 2018

I'm still not sure about the goal of 2018 yet. I've already several ideas, but
not sure which are realistic ones.

- Learn a new language, and understand the basics
- Contribute to Google Web Toolkit (GWT) project
- Contribute to AssertJ for JAX-RS integration
- Learn more about Git and JGit
- Learn more about HTTP
- Learn more about security
- Learn more about JAX-RS
- Learn more about design pattern

Let's see what will happen at the end of 2018.
