## Overview

In this article, we will see how to customize Git prompt in MinGW64
(Minimalist GNU for Windows x64). By default, when current directory is
a Git repo, MinGW only show limited information about the repository:
the name of the current branch. It does not show the current states, such as
dirty-state, untracked files, stash, upstream. This is not practical.

       alt="Before changing Git prompt (__git_ps1)" />
  Only branch name <i>"master"</i> is shown. More status?
</p>

## Short Answer

Assume that the MinGW64 (Git Bash console) is installed when you downloaded
the Git client from internet.
Add these lines into the Bash profile `~/.bash_profile`:

{% highlight bash %}
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=1
GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=1
GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto verbose"
{% endhighlight %}

and then reload the Bash profile:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile

Now, you'll see more detail about different states in your Git projects,
including dirty-state, untracked files, stash and upstream.

## Long Answer

If you want to know more about Git prompt, let's continue for a more
detailed answer. In the following paragraphs, I will explain:

- What is PS1, and how it works
- What is Git PS1
- How Git PS1 is linked to PS1

## PS1

In MinGW, you can see the value of custom prompt (PS1) by printing variable
`$PS1`. And there're two important notions here, they're
[Bash prompt escape sequences][bash-prompt-escape-sequences] and [shell
coloring][shell-color]. We will use them to understand the secrets behind PS1 :)

    $ echo $PS1
    \[\033]0;$TITLEPREFIX:${PWD//[^[:ascii:]]/?}\007\]\n\[\033[32m\]\u@\h \[\033[35m\]$MSYSTEM \[\033[33m\]\w\[\033[36m\]`__git_ps1`\[\033[0m\]\n$

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/20181111-bash-ps1.png"
       alt="Bash PS1 in MinGW64" />
</p>

The first line is the header of the window:

- The first line starts with the title prefix of the terminal. In my case, it's
  _"MINGW64"_. Then, followed by colon (`:`).
- The first line continues with the current directory using PWD (print work
  directory). Note that the result is filtered by an ASCII filter, where other
  characters will be displayed as a question mark (`?`).

The second line:

- The second line starts with the username of the current user `\u`, followed by
  symbol `@`, followed by the hostname up to the first dot (`.`). The color of this
  section is regular green (`\[\033[32m\]`).
- The second line continues with the system type `$MSYSTEM` (stands for Microsoft
  system?). This value can be `MINGW32`, `MINGW64`, or others. The color of this
  section is regular purple (`\[\033[35m\]`).
- The second line continues with the absolute path of the current working
  directory `\w` (w in lowercase). Note that w in uppercase `\W` will only show
  the last segment of the current working directory. The color of this section
  is regular yellow (`\[\033[33m\]`).
- The second line ends with the Git prompt expression `__git_ps1`. We'll go
  further on it in the next paragraph. The color of this section is regular cyan
  (`[\033[36m\]`).

After all, there're still a line feed (`\n`) for starting a new line and a
dollar symbol (`$`), which often signifies the end of the Bash prompt and the
start of the user command.

## Git Prompt (\_\_git\_ps1)

The Bash/Zsh Git prompt support is handled by script [git-prompt.sh][1].
This script allows you to see repository status in your prompt. You can define
your own preferences by providing expressions `GIT_PS1_*` to your terminal.
As far as expression `__git_ps1` is called in your PS1 substitution, the
Git status will show in your prompt.

In MinGW, we have already seen that `__git_ps1` is called in PS1 substitution:

    $ echo $PS1
    ...`__git_ps1`\[\033[0m\]\n$

So that's why we can see the Git status.

## Conclusion

In this article, we learnt how to customize Git prompt in Bash prompt using
expressions `GIT_PS1.*`. It allows us to see more than the current branch name
in Bash prompt: dirty-state, untracked files, stash and upstream. We also
understand how Bash prompt is displayed via variable `$PS1`; what is Git Prompt
and how it is linked to Bash prompt via `__git_ps1`.
Hope you enjoy this article, see you the next time!
