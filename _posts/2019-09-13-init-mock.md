## Overview

_Update: a new post is available as ["3 Ways to Init Mock in JUnit
5"](/2020/04/19/mockito-junit5/)_.

Today, I will share with you three different ways to initialize mock objects in
JUnit 4:

- `MockitoJUnitRunner`
- `MockitoAnnotations#initMocks`
- `Mockito#mock`

I will share not only the source code, but also their advantage and
inconvenience. I'm using JUnit 4 with Mockito 2.28.2.

## Prerequisites

To use the core features of Mockito 2, you need to import the following
dependency into your Maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
  <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.28.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## MockitoJUnitRunner

Mock objects can be created using Mockito JUnit Runner (`MockitoJUnitRunner`).
This runner is compatible with JUnit 4.4 and higher, this runner adds the
following behavior:

- Initializes mocks annotated with `@Mock`, so that explicit usage of
  `MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)` is not necessary. Mocks are
  initialized before each test method.
- Validates framework usage after each test method.
  See the Javadoc of [Mockito#validateMockitoUsage()][validateMockitoUsage]

[validateMockitoUsage]: https://site.mockito.org/javadoc/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#validateMockitoUsage()

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class BookReaderAnnotationWithRunnerTest {

  @Mock
  private Book mockedBook;

  private BookReader reader;

  @Before
  public void setUp() {
    reader = new BookReader(mockedBook);
  }

  @Test
  public void testGetContent() {
    when(mockedBook.getContent()).thenReturn("Mockito");
    assertEquals("Mockito", reader.getContent());
  }
}
```

Pros:

- Not need for explicit `MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)`
- Validates framework usage after each test method
- Declarative thanks to `@Mock` annotation
- Easy to read

Cons:

- Annotation `@RunWith` can only be used once. This is not a repeatable
  annotation. Using `@MockitoJUnitRunner` means you cannot use other runners
  anymore.

## MockitoAnnotations.initMocks

Mock objects can be initialized using Mockito annotation `@Mock` and
`MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)`.

```java
// no JUnit runner
public class BookReaderAnnotationWithSetupTest {

  @Mock
  private Book mockedBook;

  private BookReader reader;

  @Before
  public void setUp() {
    MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
    reader = new BookReader(mockedBook);
  }

  @Test
  public void testGetContent() {
    when(mockedBook.getContent()).thenReturn("Mockito");
    assertEquals("Mockito", reader.getContent());
  }
}
```

Pros:

- Declarative thanks to `@Mock` annotation
- Easy to read

Cons:

- Missing framework-usage validation after each test

## Mockito.mock

Create mock object of given class or interface using `Mockito#mock(Class<T>
classToMock)` or its overloaded methods.

```java
public class BookReaderClassicMockTest {

  private BookReader reader;
  private Book mockedBook;

  @Before
  public void setUp() {
    mockedBook = Mockito.mock(Book.class);
    reader = new BookReader(mockedBook);
  }

  @Test
  public void testGetContent() {
    when(mockedBook.getContent()).thenReturn("Mockito");
    assertEquals("Mockito", reader.getContent());
  }
```

Pros:

- More control on the mock you need to create

Cons:

- More verbose
- Less declarative

## Going Further

How to go further from here?

- To understand more about JUnit 4, read the official website<br>
  <https://junit.org/junit4/>
- If you want to upgrade to JUnit 5, maybe it's time. Read the official user
  guide (migration tips included)<br>
  <https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/>
- To have a more complete vision about Mockito, read the latest documentation
  from their Javadoc<br>
  <https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html>

available under [/tags/mockito](/tags/mockito).

## Conclusion

Today, I share 3 different ways to initialize mock objects in JUnit 4, using
Mockito JUnit Runner (`MockitoJUnitRunner`), Mockito Annations
(`MockitoAnnotation#initMocks`), and the traditional `Mockito#mock`.
