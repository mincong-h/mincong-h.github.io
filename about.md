Junior software engineer at Nuxeo. I'm passionated by Java development, testing,
and continous integration. I spend a lot of time on legacy code refactoring,
testing and CI improvement. Currently working with GWT, JGit, AssertJ, Selenium,
Sonar, and Checkstyle. I occasionally answer questions on [Stack Overflow][so].
Reading books is my preferred way to strengthen existing skills and learn new
ones. You can see my reading list [here][reading-list].

I'm convinced that strong typed language makes our life safer and easier. They
are not handy for small programs, but absolutely worth their value in complex
context. I love cross-platform solutions. I respect all the OS: Windows, Mac
OS, Linux. Hating an OS is easy, writing an OS that fit every user is extremely
hard.

I love programming because I believe high level abstraction gives birth to
beauty.
