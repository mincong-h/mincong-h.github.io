Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that
defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. Web services
that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide
interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful web services
allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations
of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.
Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own
arbitrary sets of operations.
