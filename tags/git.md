Git (`/ɡɪt/`) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer
files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is
primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can
be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision
control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows. For more detail, see [Wikipedia][1].
