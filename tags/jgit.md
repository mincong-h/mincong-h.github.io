JGit is an EDL (new-style BSD) licensed, lightweight, pure Java library
implementing the Git version control system for repository access routines,
network protocols, and core version control algorithms.
JGit has very few dependencies, making it suitable for embedding in any Java
application, whether or not the application is taking advantage of other
Eclipse or OSGi technologies. JGit can be found within: EGit, Gerrit Code
Review, NBGit, GitBlit, etc. For more detail, see the official website:
