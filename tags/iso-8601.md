ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange –
Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the
exchange of date- and time-related data. It was issued by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The
purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method
of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric
representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred
between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and
times. For more detail, see [Wikipedia][wiki].
