JAX-RS: Java™ API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming
language API spec that provides support in creating web services according to
the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. JAX-RS uses
annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the development and
deployment of web service clients and endpoints. All versions of JAX-RS are
part of the Java Specification Requests (JSRs):

- JSR 311: JAX-RS 1.0
- JSR 339: JAX-RS 2.0
- JSR 370: JAX-RS 2.1
