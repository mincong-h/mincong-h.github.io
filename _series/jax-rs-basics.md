JAX-RS: Javaâ„¢ API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming
language API spec that provides support in creating web services according to
the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. JAX-RS uses
annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the development and
deployment of web service clients and endpoints.
