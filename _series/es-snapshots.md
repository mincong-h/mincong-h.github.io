This series explores the feature ["Snapshot and
Restore"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshot-restore.html)
of Elasticsearch, an important and efficient way to backup your data in another
physical location (usually in the cloud provider) and increase the data
reliability of your cluster. In this series, we talk about different snapshot
repository plugins designed for different cloud providers, the RESTful APIs,
the internal structure of a repository, and application in real project.
