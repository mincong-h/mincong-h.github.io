Open data ["Demande de valeurs foncières géolocalisées
(DVF)"](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres-geolocalisees/)
is an open dataset provided by the French government which collects all the real-estate
transactions since January 2014, in mainland France and the overseas departments
and territories, except in Mayotte and Alsace-Moselle. This series uses DVF
dataset to demonstrate the features of Elasticsearch, including indexing,
storage, search, and analytics.
